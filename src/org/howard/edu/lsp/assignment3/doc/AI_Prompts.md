For my project, I used AI to help make my code more object-oriented. At first, I had a single Java file that handled the entire ETL process in one class. I asked the AI to suggest ways to make it more object-oriented while keeping the same inputs, outputs, transformations, error handling, and file paths. The AI refactored my code into a version that separated responsibilities into different components, such as a Product class to represent rows, a Transformer interface with a ProductTransformer implementation, a CSVReader and CSVWriter for file I/O, and a PipelineStats class for tracking row counts.

After that, I asked the AI to make the design even more object-oriented by splitting each class into its own file. The AI rewrote the code so that every class had a single responsibility and added Javadoc comments for documentation. This helped me clearly see how the pipeline could be broken down into smaller, reusable, and more maintainable parts, while still behaving exactly like my original code.
